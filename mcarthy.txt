Ladies and gentlemen, tonight as we celebrate the one hundred forty-first birthday of one of the greatest men in American history, I would like to be able to talk about what a glorious day today is in the history of the world.
 As we celebrate the birth of this man who with his whole heart and soul hated war, I would like to be able to speak of peace in our time—of war being outlawed—and of world-wide disarmament.
 These would be truly appropriate things to be able to mention as we celebrate the birthday of Abraham Lincoln.
Five years after a world war has been won, men’s hearts should anticipate a long peace—and men’s minds should be free from the heavy weight that comes with war.
 But this is not such a period—for this is not a period of peace.
 This is a time of “the cold war.
” This is a time when all the world is split into two vast, increasingly hostile armed camps—a time of a great armament race.
Today we can almost physically hear the mutterings and rumblings of an invigorated god of war.
 You can see it, feel it, and hear it all the way from the Indochina hills, from the shores of Formosa, right over into the very heart of Europe itself.
The one encouraging thing is that the “mad moment” has not yet arrived for the firing of the gun or the exploding of the bomb which will set civilization about the final task of destroying itself.
 There is still a hope for peace if we finally decide that no longer can we safely blind our eyes and close our ears to those facts which are shaping up more and more clearly .
 .
 .
 and that is that we are now engaged in a show-down fight .
 .
 .
 not the usual war between nations for land areas or other material gains, but a war between two diametrically opposed ideologies.
The great difference between our western Christian world and the atheistic Communist world is not political, gentlemen, it is moral.
 For instance, the Marxian idea of confiscating the land and factories and running the entire economy as a single enterprise is momentous.
 Likewise, Lenin’s invention of the one-party police state as a way to make Marx’s idea work is hardly less momentous.
Stalin’s resolute putting across of these two ideas, of course, did much to divide the world.
 With only these differences, however, the east and the west could most certainly still live in peace.
The real, basic difference, however, lies in the religion of immoralism .
 .
 .
 invented by Marx, preached feverishly by Lenin, and carried to unimaginable extremes by Stalin.
 This religion of immoralism, if the Red half of the world triumphs—and well it may, gentlemen—this religion of immoralism will more deeply wound and damage mankind than any conceivable economic or political system.
Karl Marx dismissed God as a hoax, and Lenin and Stalin have added in clear-cut, unmistakable language their resolve that no nation, no people who believe in a god, can exist side by side with their communistic state.
Karl Marx, for example, expelled people from his Communist Party for mentioning such things as love, justice, humanity or morality.
 He called this “soulful ravings” and “sloppy sentimentality.
” .
 .
 .
Today we are engaged in a final, all-out battle between communistic atheism and Christianity.
 The modern champions of communism have selected this as the time, and ladies and gentlemen, the chips are down—they are truly down.
Lest there be any doubt that the time has been chosen, let us go directly to the leader of communism today—Joseph Stalin.
 Here is what he said—not back in 1928, not before the war, not during the war—but 2 years after the last war was ended: “To think that the Communist revolution can be carried out peacefully, within the framework of a Christian democracy, means one has either gone out of one’s mind and lost all normal understanding, or has grossly and openly repudiated the Communist revolution.
” .
 .
 .
Ladies and gentlemen, can there be anyone tonight who is so blind as to say that the war is not on? Can there by anyone who fails to realize that the Communist world has said the time is now? .
 .
 .
 that this is the time for the show-down between the democratic Christian world and the communistic atheistic world?Unless we face this fact, we shall pay the price that must be paid by those who wait too long.
Six years ago, .
 .
 .
 there was within the Soviet orbit, 180,000,000 people.
 Lined up on the antitotalitarian side there were in the world at that time, roughly 1,625,000,000 people.
 Today, only six years later, there are 800,000,000 people under the absolute domination of Soviet Russia—an increase of over 400 percent.
 On our side, the figure has shrunk to around 500,000,000.
 In other words, in less than six years, the odds have changed from 9 to 1 in our favor to 8 to 5 against us.
This indicates the swiftness of the tempo of Communist victories and American defeats in the cold war.
 As one of our outstanding historical figures once said, “When a great democracy is destroyed, it will not be from enemies from without, but rather because of enemies from within.
” .
 .
 .
The reason why we find ourselves in a position of impotency is not because our only powerful potential enemy has sent men to invade our shores .
 .
 .
 but rather because of the traitorous actions of those who have been treated so well by this Nation.
 It has not been the less fortunate, or members of minority groups who have been traitorous to this Nation, but rather those who have had all the benefits that the wealthiest Nation on earth has had to offer .
 .
 .
 the finest homes, the finest college education and the finest jobs in government we can give.
This is glaringly true in the State Department.
 There the bright young men who are born with silver spoons in their mouths are the ones who have been most traitorous.
 .
 .
 .
I have here in my hand a list of 205 .
 .
 .
 a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.
 .
 .
 .
As you know, very recently the Secretary of State proclaimed his loyalty to a man guilty of what has always been considered as the most abominable of all crimes—being a traitor to the people who gave him a position of great trust—high treason.
 .
 .
 .
He has lighted the spark which is resulting in a moral uprising and will end only when the whole sorry mess of twisted, warped thinkers are swept from the national scene so that we may have a new birth of honesty and decency in government.
In the Lincoln Day speech at Wheeling Thursday night I stated that the State Department harbors a nest of Communists and Communist sympathizers who are helping to shape our foreign policy.
 I further stated that I have in my possession the names of 57 Communists who are in the State Department at present.
 A State Department spokesman promptly denied this, claiming that there is not a single Communist in the Department.
 You can convince yourself of the falsity of the State Department claim very easily.
 You will recall that you personally appointed a board to screen State Department employees for the purpose of weeding out fellow travelers—men whom the board considered dangerous to the security of this Nation.
 Your board did a painstaking job, and named hundreds which had been listed as dangerous to the security of the Nation, because of communistic connections.
While the records are not available to me, I know absolutely of one group of approximately 300 certified to the Secretary for discharge because of communism.
 He actually only discharged approximately 80.
 I understand that this was done after lengthy consultation with the now-convicted traitor, Alger Hiss.
 I would suggest, therefore, Mr.
 President, that you simply pick up your phone and ask Mr.
 Acheson how many of those whom your board had labeled as dangerous Communists he failed to discharge.
 The day the House Un-American Activities Committee exposed Alger Hiss as an important link in an international Communist spy ring you signed an order forbidding the State Department’s giving any information in regard to the disloyalty or the communistic connections of anyone in that Department to the Congress.
Despite this State Department black-out, we have been able to compile a list of 57 Communists in the State Department.
 This list is available to you but you can get a much longer list by ordering Secretary Acheson to give you a list of those whom your own board listed as being disloyal and who are still working in the State Department.
 I believe the following is the minimum which can be expected of you in this case.
